# ./python #

The .py routines found in my source directory for this project. 
Remininding myself on what these routines actually do is still to be 
done. (I can only assume that in August 2011 I thought that 
**kingbetter.py** implemented improvements over **king.py**, for 
whatever ``better'' meant to me at the time - maybe when I finally 
achieved some understanding of what the OO idiom does...)
